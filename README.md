On the Mac where it was generated, the music collection was found at "/Volumes/PowerBook SD/Music" while it is mounted locally at "/fmedia/PowerBook SD/Music".

mpconv -f "/Volumes/PowerBook SD/Music" -t "/fmedia/PowerBook SD/Music" /home/fabrice/Music/Bandcamp\ 2021.m3u8 ~/Music/Bandcamp\ 2021

This doesn't support Windows paths at the moment.

# Generation

Browse the Volumio music collection mounted at "/fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/INTERNAL" and generate playlists for each artist and year (named "Year YYYY").

Artist playlists are always sorted by release date first, then by album name and track number. Year playlists are sorted by artist first, then by album name and track number.

mpgen -m INTERNAL -d 2 -o /fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/playlists -f /fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/INTERNAL /fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/INTERNAL/
