Music Player Playlists (mppl) tools

Copyright 2021 Fabrice Colin <fabrice dot colin at gmail dot com>

Tools to convert or generate playlists suitable for [Volumio](https://volumio.com/en/) or any other mpd powered solution.

# Conversion

Convert a M3U8 playlist generated by Apple iTunes into a playlist suitable for mpd/Volumio.

On the Mac where it was generated, the music collection was found at "/Volumes/PowerBook SD/Music" while it is mounted locally at "/fmedia/PowerBook SD/Music".

```shell
$ mpconv -f "/Volumes/PowerBook SD/Music" -t "/fmedia/PowerBook SD/Music" /home/fabrice/Music/Bandcamp\ 2021.m3u8 ~/Music/Bandcamp\ 2021
```

This doesn't support Windows paths at the moment.

# Generation from a on-disk music collection

Browse the Volumio music collection mounted at "/fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/INTERNAL" and generate playlists for each artist and year (named "Year YYYY").

Artist playlists are always sorted by release date first, then by album name and track number. Year playlists are sorted by artist first, then by album name and track number.

```shell
$ mpgen -m INTERNAL -d 2 -o /fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/playlists -f /fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/INTERNAL /fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/INTERNAL/
```

# Generation from a on-disk music collection and a Bandcamp collection

Browse the Volumio music collection mounted at "/fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/INTERNAL" and generate the same playlists mpconv does, and in addition playlists for each Bandcamp purchase year (named "Bandcamp YYYY").

These additional playlists are sorted by purchase date then by artist, album name and track number.

```shell
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: Application/JSON" -d '{"fan_id":FAN_ID,"older_than_token":"CURRENT_EPOCH:0:a::","count":COLLECTION_SIZEE}' https://bandcamp.com/api/fancollection/1/collection_items >collection_items.json

$ mpbandcamp -m INTERNAL -d 2 -o /fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/playlists -f /fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/INTERNAL /fmedia/volumio_data/dyn/data/INTERNAL/ collection_items.json
```

FAN_ID is your Bandcamp fan ID. It can be obtained with your browser's developer tools, by looking at XHR requests to https://bandcamp.com/api/fancollection/1/collection_items when you press the "view all" button at the bottom of your Bandcamp collection page

CURRENT_EPOCH is the current epoch (the output of date +%s).

COLLECTION_SIZE should be equal or greater to the number of albums in your collection, as shown on the "collection" tab on the Bandcamp fan page.

This relies on the Bandcamp fancollection API which doesn't provide any track metadata, therefore the following assumes that music purchased on Bandcamp was downloaded and is available in the music collection and that tracks metadata can be looked up there.
